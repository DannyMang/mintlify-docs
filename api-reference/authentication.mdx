  **Status:** API keys are not fully live yet. This page is the intended workflow and may change.
</Note>

## Generate an API key

1. Sign in to Bijou.
2. Go to **Profile**.
3. Under **API Keys**, click **Generate**.
4. Copy the key and store it somewhere safe (you won’t be able to see it again).

<Warning>
  Treat your API key like a password. Do not commit it to GitHub or share it publicly.
</Warning>

## Use your key

Today, the deployed API Gateway for the SageMaker stack in this repo expects:

- `x-api-key: <BIJOU_API_KEY>`

We also support the more standard:

- `Authorization: Bearer <BIJOU_API_KEY>`

```bash
curl -H "x-api-key: $BIJOU_API_KEY" \
  https://api.bijou.ai/v1/models
```

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BIJOU_API_KEY" \
  https://api.bijou.ai/v1/models
```

## Rotate or revoke

- **Rotate**: generate a new key and update any services using the old key.
- **Revoke**: disable a compromised key immediately.
